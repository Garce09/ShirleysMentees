############ Q1. Ask the user for an integer, multiply it by itself + 1, and print the result
# Topic: user input






############ Q2. Ask the user for an integer
# If it is an even number, print "even"
# If it is an odd number, print "odd"

# Topic: conditionals, user input







############# Q3. Iterate through each element in the list USING A FOR LOOP, add 5 to it, and print them 
# Topic: loops + lists

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Code here





# ############# Q4. Iterate through the list and only print values that are divisible by 3 ############
# Topic: lists, loops, conditions, comparison operators

numbers = list(range(0, 500))

# Code Here

counter = 0
for number in numbers:
    if number %2 == 0:
        counter +=1

print(counter)




# ############# Q5. Iterate through the list and count the number of even numbers within the list ############
# Topic: lists, loops, conditions, comparison operators

numbers = list(range(0, 500))

# Code Here








############# Q6. Iterate through each element in the list, add 5 to it, and print them
# MUST USE A WHILE LOOP
# Topic: loops + lists
# Hint: You can use len() function

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Code here

i = 0

#run this for total # of elements in a list

while i < len(numbers):
    print(numbers[i] + 5)
    print("ran", i + 1, "time(s)")
    i += 1 





############# Q7. For the following list:
# Print ALL numbers divisible by 7 and label them like so: "Divisible by 7: 70"
# Print ALL numbers divisible by 3 and label them like so: "Divisible by 3: 6"
# Print ALL numbers divisible by 3 and 7 and label them like so: "Divisible by 3 and 7: 21"
